# Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Implementation

Welcome to this repository where various **PQC** algorithms are implemented. This mainly focuses on exploring and experimenting with crypto schemes that are thought to be secure against future quantum computers.

# Overview

As quantum computing advances, the existing implemented classical crypto schemes face threats due to their vulnerability to quantum algorithms like Shor's. In this repo, we give detailed implementation of various **pqc algos** under different categories, including:

- **Hash-Based Cryptography (SHA):**



- **Lattice based Cryptography:**



- **Code Based Cryptography:**



## Features

- Comprehensive implementations of leading PQC algorithms.
- Well-documented code suitable for educational and research purposes.
- Modular design to easily extend and add new algorithms.
- Example scripts demonstrating usage and testing.
